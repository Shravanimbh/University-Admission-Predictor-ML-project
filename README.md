#  University Admission Predictor – Linear Regression ML Project

This machine learning project focuses on predicting a student's **chance of admission** to a university based on academic performance indicators like **GRE score**, **TOEFL score**, and **CGPA**. The model is built using **Linear Regression** and emphasizes the importance of feature selection and preprocessing in improving prediction accuracy.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Python 
- Scikit-learn (`LinearRegression`)  
- Pandas (for data manipulation and preprocessing)  
- NumPy  
- jupyter notebook

## 📊 Problem Statement

Estimate the **probability of a student's admission** based on the following features:
- **GRE Score**
- **TOEFL Score**
- **CGPA**
-  **University Rating, SOP strength, LOR strength**

---

## 🧠 ML Approach

- Collected and cleaned student admission data.
- Performed **data preprocessing** (e.g., null handling, feature scaling).
- Applied **feature selection** to identify the most impactful inputs.
- Trained a **Linear Regression model** using `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluated performance using metrics such as **R² score** and **Mean Squared Error**.

## 📈 Output

- Predicts a student's **chance of admission** as a probability (0.0 – 1.0)
- Helps students identify their strong and weak areas for improvement
